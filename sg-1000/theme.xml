			<text>The Sega Computer Videogame SG-1000 is an 8-bit third generation home video game console developed by Sega and first released in Japan in 1983. A year prior, Sega Enterprises, Inc., then a subsidary of major arcade manufacturer, Gulf and Western, convinced its parent company to let it create a console during the arcade downturn. The device would sell poorly due to the Nintendo Entertainment System's superiority and congestion of consoles in the market. Bought by CSK Holdings Corporation, Sega would follow with the SG-1000 II, which was also unsuccessful. However, their accumulated experience led to the release of the Sega Mark III, also known as the Master System.</text>
